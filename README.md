# EDA_FIFA
Football, often referred to as "the beautiful game," has always been more than just a sport for meâ€”it's a passion that runs deep. The excitement of the game, the strategies employed by teams, and the sheer brilliance of players have captivated my interest for as long as I can remember. This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the FIFA dataset is a testament to my love for football and my curiosity about the analytics that drive the professional football world.

Analytics has become an indispensable part of professional football. From player performance analysis to scouting and recruitment, data-driven insights are transforming the game. My fascination with football, coupled with a desire to learn and apply data analysis techniques, led me to embark on this project. It's not just about data; it's about unraveling the intricacies of a sport I hold dear.

Project Objectives and Inquiries

This project's core revolves around EDA and serves as a stepping stone for my technical learning journey. The questions I've explored may seem basic, but they form the foundation for more advanced analyses:

Country-wise Analysis: How many players are there from each country in the dataset?
Top Footballing Nations: Which countries have the most players according to the database?
Player Salaries: Who are the top wage earners, and what positions do they play?
Top Defenders: Who are the top five defenders in the world, and what are their wages?
Analyzing English Players: Exploring the characteristics of English players, including their height, weight, and wages.
Manchester United Players: A deep dive into Manchester United's player data, including player salaries, nationalities, and positions.
Comparing Salaries: Analyzing salary disparities between foreign and domestic players at Manchester United.
Shooting vs. Wage: Is there a correlation between shooting ability and wages among English players at Manchester United?
Defending vs. Wage: Investigating the relationship between defending skills and wages at Manchester United.


Football isn't just a game; it's a global phenomenon that unites people from all walks of life. This project represents my humble attempt to merge my passion for football with my burgeoning data analysis skills.

In today's football landscape, analytics is the secret weapon behind successful clubs and national teams. By exploring the FIFA dataset, I've not only satisfied my curiosity but also gained valuable insights into the world of football data analysis.

As football continues to evolve, so will the role of data in shaping the future of the sport. With this project, I hope to inspire others to explore the beautiful game through the lens of data and analytics.
